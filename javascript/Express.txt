1. what is express.JS
    
    Express.js is a web framework for Node.js used for building web applications 
    and APIs due to its simplicity and robust features.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. MiddleWare in express

    Middleware in Express.js are functions that handle HTTP requests and responses, 
    enabling features like logging, authentication, and error handling.

 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   

3. app.use()    

   app.use() in Express.js adds middleware functions to the request processing pipeline, 
   often used for tasks like body parsing or authentication.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   

4. Routes in express  

   Routing in Express.js involves defining routes for specific HTTP methods
    (e.g., GET, POST) using app.get(), app.post(), etc.

 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   

5. error handling 

    Error handling in Express.js involves creating custom error-handling 
    middleware using app.use() to catch and respond to errors during request processing.

 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. CORS

  You can handle CORS in an Express.js application by using the cors middleware package 
  or by setting the appropriate HTTP headers manually. 
  CORS is important because it allows or restricts web applications running at one origin (domain) 
  to request resources from a different origin, ensuring security and preventing unauthorized access.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. Difference Between app.listen() and http.createServer() in Express.js:

   app.listen() 
   
   is an Express.js method that starts the Express application
   and listens for incoming HTTP requests on a specified port.

   http.createServer()

  
   http.createServer() is a Node.js core module that creates an HTTP server instance, 
   
   but it doesn't provide the higher-level routing and middleware features offered
   by Express.js.
