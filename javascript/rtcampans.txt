What is Git and Github? Difference between git and github?

Git is a distributed version control system for tracking code changes.

GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories, facilitating collaboration and code management.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What are some alternatives of github?

GitLab and Bitbucket are popular alternatives to GitHub for hosting Git repositories and collaboration.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What are cookies and sessions? Explain their difference.

Cookies are small pieces of client-side data stored in the browser.

Sessions are server-side data storage mechanisms. 

Cookies are stored on the user's device, while sessions are on the server.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


What is ReactJS, andIs it a library or framework?

  React is a  open source front-end JavaScript library 
developed by Facebook in 2011. It follows the component-based approach for building reusable
UI components, especially for single page applications

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

what happens when you change a state? 

When a state changes in React, the component re-renders to reflect the new state. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What are components in ReactJS?

Components in React are reusable UI elements.

they are classified into two components they are functional and class components

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 What is virtual DOM in React?

   The virtual DOM is  lightweight in-memory representation of the actual DOM.
   When the state changes, React compares the virtual DOM with the actual DOM and
   only makes changes to the actual DOM when necessary, which is much more efficient than 
   re-rendering the entire page.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is JSX? How is JSX parsed into JavaScript?

JSX is a JavaScript syntax extension used in React for defining UI components.
JSX is transpiled into standard JavaScript using tools like Babel before execution.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the use of Webpack?

 Webpack is like a tool that helps web developers organize and package their code and files neatly. 
 It makes websites load faster and  work smoothly by doing smart things with the code and resources.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Suppose a website is very fast, and you want to make it slower. What actions could be taken?

To slow down a fast website, you can add resource-intensive elements like large images,
 complex scripts, or excessive animations.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is a CDN, and how does it work? 

A CDN (Content Delivery Network) distributes content globally to reduce latency by 
caching data on servers located closer to users.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is Indexing in Database?

Indexing in a database is the process of optimizing data retrieval by 
creating data structures that facilitate faster search operations.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do Indexing affect only fetching, or does it affect insertion and updating too?

Indexing primarily affects data retrieval speed but can have a
 minor impact on insertion and updating due to maintenance overhead.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How do you move a commit from one branch to another branch?

You can move a commit from one branch to another using "git cherry-pick" 
or creating a patch and applying it to the target branch.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What does the git stash command do?

"git stash" temporarily saves changes that are not ready for committing, 
allowing you to switch branches or apply changes later.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Which website will be faster: one built with JavaScript or one built with React?

Website speed depends on various factors. JavaScript and React are tools used together.
 React can optimize rendering, but performance depends on implementation.

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What actions could be taken to make a website faster?

To make a website faster, optimize images, use browser caching, reduce HTTP requests, 
and employ a CDN for content delivery.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Where is session data stored in backend servers?

Session data is typically stored on the server in memory, files, or a database, 
depending on the server's configuration.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Where does Git store all the data?

Git stores all data, including repository history and configurations, in a hidden 
".git" folder in the root of the repository.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How does a .gitignore file work?

A .gitignore file specifies patterns of files and directories that Git should ignore
 when tracking changes, preventing them from being added to the repository.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to verify an email?

Email verification usually involves sending a confirmation link to the provided email address,
 and upon clicking the link, the email is considered verified.

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Which is the best method to verify email: client-based or server-based?

Server-based email verification is more reliable and secure, as it confirms email ownership on the server.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Will sessions work if we decline cookies?

Sessions often rely on cookies for tracking, so if cookies are declined, session functionality may be affected.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why do sessions get destroyed when reopening a website after closing it?

Sessions have a timeout, and if the timeout is reached or the browser is closed,
 the session data is destroyed, requiring a new login.

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is GitHub's cherry-pick command?

"git cherry-pick" is a Git command used to select and apply specific commits from one branch to another.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is DOM (Document Object Model)?

DOM is a programming interface representing a web page's structure, allowing manipulation 
and access to its elements via scripts.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is encryption and decryption?

Encryption is the process of converting data into a secure format, 
while decryption reverses this process to retrieve the original data.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is hashing?

Hashing is the process of converting data into a fixed-size string (hash) 
using a hashing algorithm. It's often used for secure data storage or integrity verification.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the purpose of salting?

Salting adds random data to hashed passwords to enhance security by making it 
more challenging for attackers to use precomputed tables (rainbow tables).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How does JWT work? How do symmetric and asymmetric algorithms work in JWT?

JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, self-contained token used for secure data transmission. 
Symmetric algorithms use a shared secret key, while asymmetric algorithms use public-private
 key pairs for signing and verifying tokens.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do all hashing algorithms generate hash values of fixed size strings of characters?

No, not all hashing algorithms generate fixed-size hash values; some allow variable-length outputs.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Can there be two computers with the same public IP? How does a router assign IP addresses?

Yes, multiple computers can share the same public IP through Network Address Translation (NAT).
 Routers assign local IP addresses to devices using DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What happens when you hit a URL when connected with a router?

When you hit a URL, the router forwards the request to the appropriate device in the 
local network based on port forwarding rules.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What if two computers connected to the same router are assigned the same IP address?

Assigning the same IP to multiple devices can cause conflicts; routers usually 
assign unique IPs within the local network.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How would you implement automatic video quality control, like YouTube?

Implement adaptive streaming based on available bandwidth, selecting the appropriate
 video quality for seamless playback.

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Suppose your site is experiencing high traffic, causing lag. How would you manage it to reduce server load?

Employ load balancing, caching, content delivery networks (CDN), and optimize database 
queries to handle high traffic efficiently.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Which data structure does "Lift" use?

The term "Lift" in React typically refers to lifting state up in the component hierarchy,
 often involving data structures like arrays or objects.

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


What is event bubbling?

Event bubbling is a process where events propagate from child elements to parent elements in the DOM hierarchy.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How does React re-render components?

React re-renders components when their state or props change, ensuring a consistent and efficient UI update.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is HTTP, and what's the difference between HTTP and HTTPS?

HTTP is a protocol for transmitting data over the web. HTTPS is a secure version 
of HTTP that encrypts data by protecting it from interception.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is jQuery, and which is more efficient: jQuery or JavaScript?

jQuery is a JavaScript library simplifying DOM manipulation. JavaScript is more efficient 
for modern development, as jQuery may introduce unnecessary overhead.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How can you intentionally slow down a fast website?

To slow down a fast website, you can add resource-intensive elements like large images,
 complex scripts, or delays in data loading.

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If a website is slow despite quality hardware, how can you identify and fix the issue?

Slow website performance may be due to code bottlenecks, inefficient database queries, 
or external services. Use profiling and monitoring tools to identify and optimize these areas.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What are SQL indexes?

SQL indexes are database structures that optimize data retrieval by creating organized data
 structures for efficient querying.

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How can you insert a string into a numbers-only input box in HTML?

You can use JavaScript to manipulate the input's value property and ensure it only accepts numeric input.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What's the difference between webpack plugins and loaders?

Webpack plugins extend the build process, while loaders process specific file types during bundling, 
like transpiling JavaScript or handling CSS.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


What are Processes and Threads?

Processes are independent program instances, while threads are lightweight sub-processes
 running within a process, sharing the same memory space.

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is Composer and its files?

Composer is a PHP dependency management tool. It uses a "composer.json" file to specify project 
dependencies and generates a "composer.lock" file to lock dependencies to specific versions.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are client-side and server-side validation?

Client-side validation occurs in the user's browser, checking input before submission.

 Server-side validation happens on the server, ensuring data integrity and security.
